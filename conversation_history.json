Data science is multifaceted and can be described as a science, a research paradigm, a research method, a discipline, a workflow, and a profession.\n\n**Related topics:**\n- [Data science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_science)\n- [Data engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_engineering)\n- [Master in Data Science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master_in_Data_Science)"

A datum is an individual value in a collection of data. Data are usually organized into structures such as tables that provide additional context and meaning, and may themselves be used as data in larger structures.\n\n**Related topics:**\n- [Data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data)\n- [Data science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_science)\n- [Data engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_engineering)"
